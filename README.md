# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

goerli-CBD:

goerli-purchase:
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0700620130188a8F463f8d54139ED3f5F589Ad35

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
